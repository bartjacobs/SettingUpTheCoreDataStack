### [Setting Up the Core Data Stack With NSPersistentContainer](https://cocoacasts.com/setting-up-the-core-data-stack-with-nspersistentcontainer/)

#### Author: Bart Jacobs

In the [previous tutorial](https://cocoacasts.com/exploring-the-core-data-stack/), you learned about the Core Data stack and the classes involved. In this tutorial, we take a close look at Xcode's template for Core Data applications.

## Setting Up the Project

Open Xcode and select **New > Project...** from the **File** menu. Choose the **Single View Application** template from the **iOS > Application** section and click **Next**.

Name the application **Core Data**, enter an organization name and identifier, and set **Language** to **Swift**. Check the **Use Core Data** checkbox to make sure Xcode adds the necessary files and code for working with Core Data.

## Exploring Files and Folders

The project includes a file that may be new to you, **Core_Data.xcdatamodeld**. This is the data model I talked about in the [previous tutorial](https://cocoacasts.com/exploring-the-core-data-stack/). Select the file to take a quick peek at its contents.

Because the data model doesn't contain any entities yet, there isn't much to see. We take a closer look at the data model and the data model editor in [Mastering Core Data With Swift 3](https://cocoacasts.com/mastering-core-data-with-swift-3/).
